## Summary

#### To run Cakehouse simply download it to your machine and start it with **npm start**

#### Building CakeHouse webapp helped me to understand BEM methodology and usage of Redux. It was challenging to create toggles for language and dark/light theme from scratch.

### Todo

#### Toggle to switch labels to etykiety (connect toggle and contact)

#### background-image (saved in style.scss, use at "home" -> index.jsx)

#### scroll-up button at bottom (privacy-policy -> index.jsx)
